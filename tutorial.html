            <p>
                If you dont have github installed you can download the file as a zip from the github repo. 
                Otherwise clone <a href="https://github.com/FFreezer/InternetTechnologiesCoursework1" target="#">this project</a>

            <h3>Download Package Files</h3>
            <p>
                Navigate using your console to the project directory and <pre>run npm install</pre>

            <h3>Database Connection Details</h3>
            <p>
                Once you've downloaded the project open your <pre>db_config.js</pre> file and modify it to use these values
                <br />
                <pre>const db_username = "tutorialuser";</pre> <br />
                <pre>const db_password = "7CQLhe6Bfx6tUCXC";</pre> <br />

            <h3>Test the application</h3>
            <p>
                Once you've modified the above values you should be able to run <pre>npm run dev</pre> and the application will 
                boot. You should see a message in your console saying <br /> <pre>MongoDB Connected <br />Application is listening on port 8080. Browse to http://localhost:8080/graphql</pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                Open your browser and navigate to <pre>localhost:8080/graphql</pre>. A window should load with a panel on the left
                and a panel on the right. 
                <br />
                In the left hand panel copy and paste the following.
                <br />
                <pre>
                    query {

                          items {
                            name
                            tags
                            price
                            quantity
                          }
                          customer {
                            gender
                            age
                            email
                            satisfaction
                          }
                        }
                      }
                    </pre>
                <br>
                Hit the <pre>prettify</pre> button to format the text into something more readable.
                Now hit the play button in the middle of the screen. This query may take a little while to load as you're fetching <strong>every</strong>
                entry in the collection (/database).
            </p>
            <p>
                Now try changing the query to getSaleById. You'll need an ID to query the database with. Heres a random one <pre>5bd761dcae323e45a93ccff0</pre>.
                after the word getSaleById put round parentheses and press <pre>LCtrl & Space</pre>. It should auto fill the word <pre>id</pre>.
                Now if you put your ID in quotes after the letters <pre>id</pre> like this <pre>id:"5bd761dcae323e45a93ccff0"</pre> and hit search you should
                get back only that result.

            <h3>Task Specification</h3>
            <p>Create a new query that searches the database for a record based on the customers email address. You should only have to modify the files <pre>typeDefs.js & sales.js</pre></p>
            <p>Use the code that is already given to you to help you understand how to </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Modifying Your Type Definitions</h3>
            <p>First you're going to need to add the query we want to make to your list of queries. Do to this 
                go into your <pre>typeDefs.js</pre> file and modify the query type near the bottom.
                Add a new line that says 
                <pre>getSaleByCustomerEmail(email_in: String) : Sale</pre>
                This takes one argument of type String and will return one Sale object. You can look at what a Sale object is 
                by scrolling to the top of the file and looking at the <pre>type Sale</pre> definition.
            </p>

            <h3>Making our resolver</h3>
            <p>
                Create a new resolver by going into <pre>sales.js</pre> and underneath the <pre>getSaleById</pre> function make a new funciton with
                <pre>async function getSaleByCustomerEmail(parent, args, context, info){}</pre>
                First we need to get the arguments we've passed to the resolver, these are stored as key value pairs in our args argument.
                To access these we need to destructure the object. You can do this either in the function signature or in the body. We'll do it in the body.
                <pre>
                    getSaleByCusomterEmail(parent,args,context,info) {
                        const { email_in : email } = args;
                    }
                </pre>
                Now we can access the email address we pass into our query by accessing the email variable.

                We've got a Sale model thats built using Mongoose for MongoDB. These models come with powerful search functionality.
                We can use the model to query our database. Remember, GraphQL doesn't actually query your database, in this instance it sits in between your database driver and your application.
            </p>

            <h3>Querying Our Database</h3>
            <p>
                We can asynchronously query our database with Model.find() to get all results or  just Model.findOne() to get one result. We're going to use findOne here.
                Use 
                <pre>
                    const sale = await Sale.findOne({ 'customer.email ' : email });
                    const sale_json = sale.toJSON();
                    return {
                        ...sale_json
                    }
                </pre>
            </p>
        </div>
